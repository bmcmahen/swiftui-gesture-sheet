#  swiftui-gesture-sheet

An example of how to combine gestures and animations to create a side sheet style component. This is all pretty hacked together, but I may eventually clean it up and release it as a library. For now, it's part of my effort to map [react design pattersn in swiftui](https://github.com/bmcmahen/react-meets-swiftui) and the code is actually loosely based off of my react implementation found in [sancho](https://github.com/bmcmahen/sancho).
